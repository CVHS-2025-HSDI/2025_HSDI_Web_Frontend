            In AP Drawing, you’ll use the skills you learn in the course, and your own ideas, to create unique works of art. Throughout the course, you’ll develop an inquiry that guides artmaking through practice, experimentation, and revision of materials, processes, and ideas while demonstrating drawing skills through painting, drawing, sequential art, printmaking, illustration, animation, fibers, and others.
